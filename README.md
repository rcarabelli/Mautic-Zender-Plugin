## Mautic Whatsapp (via Zender) Plugin v.1.1.14
This plugin replaces the SMS channel and allows you to send messages to Whatsapp
using a Zender account (https://codecanyon.net/item/zender-android-mobile-devices-as-sms-gateway-saas-platform/26594230).
Intended for >= Mautic 5.1

This plugin was created based on this previous plugin:
https://joeykeller.com/weekend-project-a-mautic-whatsapp-plugin

## What does this Plugin do
This plugin lets you send WhatsApp messages using "Zender" as a bridge between Mautic and WhatsApp. The main advantage is that Zender is like a WhatsApp web emulator, so you can use standard "WhatsApp" and "WhatsApp business" accounts with it and you won't get charged for sending each message like what happens with "WhatsApp Business API". Of course, it has its limits, and they are explained in "Things to consider" some lines below.

Once you have this installed and running, you will be able to use the "Text Messages" channel to send via your own WhatsApp numbers with all the perks Mautic has, including link tracking, follow up, and so on, and with the extra advantage that all traffic is saved into your own Zender's database so you can use that for any purpose you find useful.

Zender also has a nice API, so each WhatsApp answer you get can also be processed.

## New Features
- Fetch and process WhatsApp messages from Zender, including status updates.
- New fields added to the leads table to track the last sent and received message dates, statuses, and contents.

## What happens on installation
1. Mautic Plugin is activated, appearing in your plugins page showing the red 7 Cats logo.
2. Creates a new "custom field" called "ID WhatsApp in Zender/id_whatsapp_in_zender" where the Zender token of a WhatsApp number should be placed (each contact you want to send a message to must have this field filled).
3. Creates a Plugin option in "plugins" where you will have to fill 3 form fields to activate this (Zender API Key, Zender API URL, Shortener Link).
4. Six new fields are added to the leads table to save the last sent and received messages:
    - `last_sent_message_date` (varchar(64))
    - `last_sent_message_status` (varchar(64))
    - `last_sent_message_content` (varchar(255))
    - `last_received_message_date` (varchar(64))
    - `last_received_message_content` (varchar(255))
    - `last_received_message_status` (varchar(64))
5. A table named `maugittest_zender_api_request_log` is created to save the JSON responses from the Zender API.

## Usage

### How to Use the Plugin

1. **Create a New Campaign:**
   - In Mautic, create a new campaign.

2. **Choose a Segment:**
   - Select a segment that contains contacts with phone numbers.

3. **Create or Select a Text Message:**
   - Include text, image URLs (jpg, jpeg, gif, png), or video URLs (mp4 only), emojis, and line breaks in the message.
   - The message accepts Mautic placeholders (e.g., `{contactfield=firstname}`).

4. **Update and Trigger the Campaign:**
   - Wait for the campaign to update and trigger automatically or force an update.

5. **Message Processing:**
   - The plugin will check for media files in the links you provided.
   - If no media files are found, the message will be sent as text.
   - If media files are found, the first image will be visible in the WhatsApp message, and other media will be sent as links.

6. **Send the Message:**
   - The plugin will send the message via the Zender API, using placeholders for personalization.
   - Zender will download the image (if any) and send the message to WhatsApp.

7. **Track and Process Responses:**
   - Zender will resend the message from your configured WhatsApp numbers.
   - The plugin will fetch and process message statuses and responses from Zender, updating the lead's profile accordingly.

## Fetching and Processing Messages

### Fetch and Process Messages

The plugin fetches messages from Zender and updates the lead profiles with the status, date, and content of the sent and received messages. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Fetch Messages:**
   - The plugin fetches messages from Zender using the API.
   - It retrieves messages of types: `wa.pending`, `wa.received`, and `wa.sent`.

2. **Process Messages:**
   - For each fetched message, the plugin logs the API request and processes the message data.
   - The message data is saved in a table (`maugittest_zender_api_request_log`), and the lead's profile is updated with the message information.

3. **Update Lead Profiles:**
   - The plugin updates the lead's profile with the last sent and received message dates, statuses, and contents.

## Setting Up Cron Job

### Setting Up the Cron Job

To automate the fetching and processing of messages, you need to set up a cron job:

1. **Open your crontab file for editing:**
   - Run the command: `crontab -e`.

2. **Add the following line to schedule the command to run every 15 minutes:**
   */15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/mautic/bin/console mautic:zender:sync-messages

3. Save and exit the crontab editor.

## Running the Command Manually

If you need to run the command manually, use the following command in your terminal:

php /path/to/your/mautic/bin/console mautic:zender:sync-messages

Replace /path/to/your/mautic with the actual path to your Mautic installation.

## Things to Consider

### WhatsApp Limitations:
- WhatsApp closely monitors non-API accounts for spam, so you cannot send too many messages per hour.

### Sending Speed:
- Configure Zender to send messages randomly between 80 to 160 seconds per message to avoid detection.

### Daily Limits:
- It is recommended not to send more than 300 messages daily per WhatsApp number.
- For larger campaigns, use multiple WhatsApp numbers (e.g., 10 numbers for 3,000 contacts).

### Receiving Messages:
- Zender can receive messages, and you can process these responses using Zender's API.

### Monthly Message Limits:
- You can safely send at least 9,000 WhatsApp campaign messages per month.
- Using the WhatsApp Business API for the same volume could cost around $225.00.

### Use Cases:
- The plugin is ideal for small budget/team projects with databases of less than 10,000 contacts.
- It can also be used for alerts, shopping cart recovery, store communications, and team updates.
